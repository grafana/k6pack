## Breaking Changes

### Merging the Imports() and Pack() functions

In practice, it turned out that the return value of the `Imports()` and `Pack()` functions is mostly needed by the caller at the same time. Therefore, the `Imports()` function has been merged into the `Pack()` function. The `Pack()` function returns a `Metadata` struct whose `Imports` field contains the k6 imports found in the input script (core modules and extensions).

## Features

### Making the k6pack CLI command reusable

Making the cobra Command, which implements the pack command, available using the factory function (`cmd.New()`). This allows the `pack` command to be included as a subcommand in other tools.
