Bundle TypeScript/JavaScript sources into a single k6 test script.

**sourcemap**

Sourcemap is disabled by default. If sourcemap is enabled, the current directory will be set in the sourcemap as the source root directory. This can be changed by using the `--source-root` flag. You can even disable the source root setting by specifying the empty string.
